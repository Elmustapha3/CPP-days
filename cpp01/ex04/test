Add public member functions to your class to overload the following operators:
• The 6 comparison operators: >, <, >=, <=, == and !=.
• The 4 arithmetic operators: +, -, *, and /.
• The 4 increment/decrement (pre-increment and post-increment, pre-decrement and
post-decrement) operators, that will increase or decrease the fixed-point value from
the smallest representable ϵ such as 1 + ϵ > 1.
